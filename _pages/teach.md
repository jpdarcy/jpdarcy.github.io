I am now actively teaching the following courses at the University of Delaware: 
### MISY 650, Security & Control (Graduate course)
This course is a survey of topics in the realm of information security. It considers many contemporary topics ranging from basic security threats to cyber-warfare to security ethics to legal and cultural differences between countries. The course emphasizes managerial decision making through analyzing security problems and understanding effective solutions. The course culminates in a research project in which students conduct a real-world information technology risk assessment using an organization of thier choice. 
### MISY 667, Cybersecurity Management (Graduate course)
This course is a broad introduction to managerial issues in cybersecurity. The topics of the class range widely, including technical (e.g., cryptography), managerial (e.g., defense methods for organizations), physical (e.g., door locks) and psychological (e.g., social engineering) issues. A key objective of the class is to develop a security mindset, in which one learns to think like an attacker for ways to exploit a system. 
### MISY 305, Information Security & Risk Management (Undergraduate course)
This course is a survey of topics in the realm of information security. It considers many contemporary topics ranging from basic security threats to cyber-warfare to security ethics to legal and cultural differences between countries. Emphasis is placed on human and technological aspects of information security and issues relevant to the risks to which information systems are exposed and methods of dealing with such risks.
